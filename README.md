# RASA-TATTVA Indian Restaurant Landing Page

This project is a responsive landing page design for an Indian restaurant named "rasa-tattva". The design is based on HTML and CSS, utilizing the Vite build tool, AOS (Animate On Scroll) library, and following the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming methodology.

## Tools Used

- **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides a highly efficient development workflow with features like hot module replacement and optimized builds.

- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: A library that animates elements on scroll, adding a visually appealing touch to the landing page.

- **BEM Naming Methodology**: A methodology for naming CSS classes in a way that promotes maintainability and reusability.

## Customization

To customize the content, appearance, or add additional features, you can follow these steps:

1. Explore the `css` directory to find stylesheets of components like the header, menu, and more.

2. Modify the corresponding HTML and CSS files to make changes to the structure and styling.

3. Add new components or sections as needed. Make sure to follow the BEM naming methodology for consistency.

4. Update the images in the `assets/` directory with your own visuals.

5. Experiment with different animations or effects by adjusting settings in the `AOS` library or adding your own.

6. Run `npm run dev` to see the changes in real-time during development.


## This concludes the README for the "rasa-tattva" Indian Restaurant Landing Page Design.
